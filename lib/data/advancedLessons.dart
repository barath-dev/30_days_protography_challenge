## Beyond Technical Correctness

Professional photography uses exposure creatively, not just technically. Learn to control mood and impact through deliberate exposure choices.

### Intentional Overexposure (High-Key)
• Creates bright, airy mood (+1 to +2 stops)
• Flatters skin tones in portraits
• Popular for lifestyle and beauty photography
• Requires careful highlight preservation

### Intentional Underexposure (Low-Key)
• Dramatic, moody atmosphere (-1 to +2 stops)
• Emphasizes form and texture
• Common in luxury and editorial work
• Preserve shadow detail where needed

### Zone System Basics
Ansel Adams' system divides tones into 11 zones (0-X):
• Zone V: Middle gray (meter reading)
• Zone III: Textured shadows
• Zone VII: Textured highlights
Place key subjects in appropriate zones for desired effect.

### Practical Application
1. Identify key subject tone
2. Determine desired zone placement
3. Meter and adjust exposure
4. Verify with histogram
5. Refine as needed

### Scene-Specific Strategies
**Portraits:** Skin typically Zone IV-VI
**Landscapes:** Balance sky and foreground (2-3 stop difference)
**Products:** Control background separately from subject

      "content": """# Focus Stacking Mastery

## What is Focus Stacking?

Taking multiple photos at different focus distances, then blending in post to create extended depth of field impossible in a single shot.

### Why Stack Focus?
• Overcome depth of field limitations
• Use optimal aperture (avoid diffraction)
• Commercial detail requirements
• Macro photography necessity

### Essential Setup
**Required:**
• Sturdy tripod (critical)
• Manual focus control
• Consistent lighting
• Focus stacking software

**Recommended:**
• Macro rail for precise movement
• Remote shutter release
• Camera with focus bracketing

### Shooting Technique

**Camera Settings:**
• Manual mode
• Optimal aperture (f/5.6-f/11)
• Manual focus
• Lowest ISO
• RAW format

**Focus Sequence:**
1. Start at nearest focus point
2. Take first shot
3. Move focus incrementally
4. Overlap 30-40% between frames
5. Continue to farthest point

**Guidelines:**
• Macro (1:1): 20-50 shots, 1-2mm increments
• Product: 5-15 shots, 5-10mm increments
• Landscape: 3-5 shots, hyperfocal distances

### Post-Processing

**Software Options:**
• Photoshop (auto-stack layers)
• Helicon Focus (specialized)
• Zerene Stacker (macro standard)

**Workflow:**
1. Import image sequence
2. Auto-align frames
3. Blend stacked images
4. Refine and remove artifacts
5. Final adjustments

### Common Issues
**Halos:** Reduce blend radius, manual masking
**Ghosting:** Subject moved, use clone tool
**Poor alignment:** Reshoot with better stability

### Applications
• E-commerce products
• Jewelry photography
• Macro nature photography
• Landscape foreground-to-background
• Architectural detail work

Focus stacking is essential for commercial work requiring exceptional sharpness throughout the frame.""",

      "content": """# HDR Photography

## High Dynamic Range Explained

HDR combines multiple exposures to capture scenes with brightness range exceeding single-shot capability.

### When to Use HDR
• High-contrast landscapes (bright sky, dark foreground)
• Interior/exterior combinations (real estate)
• Architectural photography
• Any scene exceeding camera dynamic range

**Don't use HDR:**
• Moving subjects (creates ghosting)
• When single exposure suffices
• Fast-changing light conditions

### HDR Capture Technique

**Camera Setup:**
• Tripod required (critical)
• Manual mode
• Aperture priority acceptable
• Auto-bracketing feature
• RAW format

**Bracket Settings:**
• Standard: 3 shots (-2, 0, +2 EV)
• High contrast: 5 shots (-4, -2, 0, +2, +4)
• Extreme: 7-9 shots

**Shooting Process:**
1. Compose and lock tripod
2. Set base exposure
3. Enable bracketing
4. Use burst mode or timer
5. Shoot complete sequence

### Natural HDR Processing

**The Goal:** Realistic enhancement, not over-processed look

**Software Options:**
• Lightroom (Photo Merge HDR)
• Photomatix Pro (industry standard)
• Aurora HDR (user-friendly)
• Photoshop (Merge to HDR Pro)

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Import Bracket**
   • Load exposure sequence
   • Ensure alignment
   • Check for movement

2. **Initial Merge**
   • Auto-align images
   • De-ghost moving elements
   • Generate 32-bit HDR

3. **Tone Mapping**
   • Compress dynamic range
   • Maintain natural look
   • Avoid halos and artifacts

4. **Refinement**
   • Recover highlights
   • Lift shadows naturally
   • Enhance local contrast
   • Control color saturation

### Avoiding HDR Mistakes

**Common Pitfalls:**

❌ **Over-processed look**
• Too much structure/clarity
• Unnatural halos
• Over-saturated colors
**Fix:** Reduce strength, subtle adjustments

❌ **Ghosting artifacts**
• Moving subjects (people, cars, trees)
• Clouds in different positions
**Fix:** Use deghosting, manual masking

❌ **Poor alignment**
• Camera movement between shots
• Hand-held shooting
**Fix:** Always use tripod, reshoot

❌ **Flat, lifeless images**
• Over-compression of tones
• Loss of contrast
**Fix:** Maintain some contrast, targeted adjustments

### Natural HDR Principles

**Keep it Subtle:**
• HDR should be invisible
• Viewer shouldn't detect processing
• Enhance, don't transform

**Targeted Adjustments:**
• Use graduated filters digitally
• Adjust sky and foreground separately
• Maintain natural light direction

**Contrast Management:**
• Don't flatten all tones
• Preserve shadows where appropriate
• Keep highlights interesting

### Real Estate HDR

**Specific Technique:**
• 3-bracket standard (-2, 0, +2)
• Interior/exterior balance
• Natural window light
• Warm, inviting tone

**Client Expectations:**
• Bright, open spaces
• Visible detail everywhere
• Natural color temperature
• Minimal artifacts

### Landscape HDR

**Best Practices:**
• Shoot during golden hour
• 3-5 brackets usually sufficient
• Watch for cloud movement
• Enhance natural drama

**Processing Goals:**
• Rich, detailed shadows
• Textured clouds
• Natural color saturation
• Maintained depth

### Architectural HDR

**Considerations:**
• Straight lines (avoid halos)
• Texture preservation
• Natural material appearance
• Balance interior/exterior

### Alternative: Single-RAW HDR

Modern cameras have excellent dynamic range. Sometimes "HDR" processing on single RAW works:

**When to Use:**
• Static scenes, no time for brackets
• Moving elements present
• Quick workflow needed

**Technique:**
• Expose to the right (ETTR)
• Push shadows in post
• Pull highlights as needed
• Less dynamic range than true HDR

### HDR for Different Genres

**Real Estate:** Clean, bright, inviting
**Landscape:** Dramatic but natural
**Architecture:** Detailed, balanced
**Interior:** Well-lit, color-accurate

### Workflow Efficiency

**Time Investment:**
• Shooting: 2-3 minutes per scene
• Processing: 5-15 minutes per HDR
• Batch processing available

**File Management:**
• Keep brackets organized
• Name HDRs clearly
• Archive original brackets

HDR done right enhances dynamic range naturally, providing commercial-quality results for challenging lighting situations.""",
